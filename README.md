JERB, THE JOB HELPER APP

Consolidate and track your job searches.

FRONT-END BUILT WITH:

AngularJS CSS3 HTML5

BACK-END BUILT WITH:

nodeJS Express MongoDB

PURPOSE:

Originally this was just a school project assignment but has turned into a valuable tool for tracking my own job searches upon graduation. One of the problems I noticed fellow students were having was they were losing track of jobs they'd applied for. They would get emails from recruiters but forget the specific position they applied for! Its understandable given the sheer volume of applications everyone was putting out. 

Another issue was the fact that each job application was made from different sites (e.g. indeed, careerbuilder, etc) and often the same listing would show up across many sites. It was easy to forget which positions you had already applied to, and if you did, from which site you had applied from. I built Jerb to help consolidate all the most important info in one place so as to save time and energy in the very stressful process of job hunting. 

TO USE:

Create an account.
From the navigation bar you can add new listings and see/edit your old ones.
I highly recommend adding the URL link to each job listing so you can easily remember where you originally applied from. 
You can mark each listing as 'applied' or 'responded to' as you progress through your job searches.
The search bar makes it easy to sort through your past listings.
